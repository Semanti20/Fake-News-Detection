# Fake-News-Detection
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify news articles as either "fake" or "true". This will be achieved by training and evaluating various classification algorithms on a dataset of labeled news articles.

Approach:

Data: Load, combine, and label fake/true news data.

Preprocessing: Clean text data (remove special characters, URLs, lowercase).

Split: Divide data into training and testing sets.

Feature Extraction: Convert text to numbers using TF-IDF.

Modeling: Train Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models.

Evaluation: Assess model performance (classification reports, confusion matrices).

Comparison: Visualize model accuracy.

Selection: Choose the best performing model.

Prediction: Create a function to classify new user-inputted text and get the accuracy of the model.

Expected Outcome: The project will deliver a functional machine learning model capable of classifying news articles as fake or true with reasonable accuracy. Additionally, it provides a user-friendly function to input text and get the prediction and the model's accuracy score.

Tools and Technologies:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (for machine learning)

Matplotlib and Seaborn (for visualization)
